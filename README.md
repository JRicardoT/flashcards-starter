# FlashCards

## Description:
Flashcards is a game that is playable through the CLI (Command-Line-Interface). In the game you will be prompted a question, and have the opportunity to select an answer that will provide feedback letting you know if you are correct or not. You will be able to play through the entire deck of cards and log the the percentage of correct answers after a whole round.

## Setup

### Fork This Repo
On the top right corner of this page, click the Fork button.

Clone down the forked repo (from your GitHub). Since you don't want to name your project "flashcards-starter", you can use an optional argument when you run `git clone` (you replace the `[...]` with the terminal command arguments):

```bash
git clone [remote-address] [what you want to name the repo]
```

Once you have cloned the repo, change into the directory and install the library dependencies. Run:

```bash
npm install
```

Running `node index.js` from the root of your project should result in the game being displayed in your terminal.
